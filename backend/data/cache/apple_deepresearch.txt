.)
People & Key Bodies: Apple is led by Tim Cook, CEO since 2011
forbes.com
, who has overseen its growth to a $3 trillion market cap. Luca Maestri, CFO from 2014 through 2024, managed Apple’s finances and is transitioning roles
en.wikipedia.org
. The Board of Directors is chaired by Arthur D. Levinson (Chairman since 2011)
en.wikipedia.org
. Other pivotal executives include COO Jeff Williams, hardware engineering lead John Ternus, operations chief Sabih Khan, services chief Eddy Cue, and others in Apple’s top team

. Externally, major regulatory bodies have Apple in their sights. In the US, the Department of Justice Antitrust Division (with multiple state AGs) filed a lawsuit in 2024 accusing Apple of unlawfully monopolizing smartphone app distribution
justice.gov
. In Europe, the European Commission (DG Competition) enforces antitrust and the new Digital Markets Act (DMA) against Apple – in March 2024 the Commission fined Apple €1.84 billion over App Store rules that harmed music streaming competitors
networklawreview.org
, and it has formally designated Apple as a “gatekeeper” under the DMA, mandating opening of iOS to alternative app stores and payments
techpolicy.press
techpolicy.press
. In the UK, the Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) concluded in 2025 that Apple’s mobile browser and app store policies restrict competition, findings that will inform new digital market regulations

.
Geographies: Apple’s corporate headquarters (Apple Park) is in Cupertino, California, USA
naics.com
, and the United States remains Apple’s largest single market by revenue. China is pivotal both as a huge consumer market (≈19% of revenue
reuters.com
) and as the primary manufacturing base for Apple products – “substantially all” Apple devices are made by partners primarily in mainland China, with large production campuses employing hundreds of thousands
sec.gov
androidauthority.com
. In recent years, Apple has significantly expanded production in India, now assembling an estimated 14% of iPhones (by value) in India in 2023
mobileworldlive.com
; Apple opened its first India retail stores in 2023 as that market and manufacturing hub grow in importance. Vietnam has become Apple’s largest production base in Southeast Asia with 35 supplier facilities by 2023
vietnam-briefing.com
 – a major center for AirPods, iPads, and Apple Watch assembly
vietnam-briefing.com
androidauthority.com
. Taiwan is another critical geography, as home to TSMC’s advanced chip fabs that produce Apple’s A-series and M-series processors
tweaktown.com
, as well as other key component suppliers. In Europe, Apple’s operations are anchored in Ireland – Apple’s European headquarters in Cork (established 1980) hosts manufacturing and support teams and plays a central role in Apple’s international structure
apple.com
. Other top markets include Europe (as a region, second to the Americas in revenue) and Japan. Apple navigates complex geopolitics across these regions, from EU data/privacy rules to US–China trade tensions.
Regulation & Policy (Recent): Apple faces intensifying regulatory scrutiny. In the United States, the DOJ’s 2024 antitrust suit and parallel congressional debates challenge Apple’s App Store policies (e.g. banning alternative app stores/payment systems). EU – Digital Markets Act: In Sept 2023, the EU formally named Apple a core platform “gatekeeper”, compelling changes like allowing third-party app stores and sideloading by March 2024
techpolicy.press
techpolicy.press
; by mid-2024 the Commission had already warned Apple that its in-app rules (anti-steering provisions) violate the DMA
techpolicy.press
 and opened investigations into Apple’s compliance (including Apple’s proposed 27% “app link” fee)
techpolicy.press
techpolicy.press
. EU Antitrust Enforcement: Separately, after a multi-year inquiry prompted by Spotify, the European Commission in March 2024 fined Apple €1.8 billion for abusing its dominant position by restricting rival music streaming apps – a record antitrust penalty aimed at Apple’s App Store practices
networklawreview.org
. UK: The CMA’s market investigation (2021–2023) found Apple and Google’s mobile ecosystem dominance was harming competition; in 2023–2025 the CMA has been preparing new regulatory regimes, and in March 2025 it confirmed that Apple’s browser engine restrictions and App Store rules stifle innovation, to be addressed under upcoming UK digital competition laws
gov.uk
gov.uk
. China: In 2023, China’s government imposed informal iPhone usage bans for officials (prohibiting iPhones for work in certain agencies)
reuters.com
 – a retaliatory policy amid US–China tech rifts that raised concerns for Apple, given China’s importance to Apple’s sales and supply chain
reuters.com
. Meanwhile, U.S.–China export controls (Oct 2022) directly impacted Apple’s supplier plans: Apple halted its planned use of Chinese YMTC memory chips in iPhones after the U.S. tightened chip export rules
reuters.com
. The broad U.S. curbs on advanced semiconductors aim to limit China’s tech capabilities
reuters.com
, forcing Apple to rely on non-Chinese chip suppliers and diversify production (accelerating shifts to India/Vietnam
reuters.com
). Apple must continuously adapt to these regulatory mandates, balancing compliance and its tight control over its ecosystem.
Recent High-Impact Events (24 mo): Product Launches: In June 2023, Apple introduced the Apple Vision Pro headset, its most ambitious new product in years, marking Apple’s entry into mixed reality – “the beginning of a new era for computing,” per CEO Tim Cook
apple.com
. Annual iPhone launches continued (iPhone 15 series in Sept 2023 featuring the A17 Pro chip built on TSMC’s 3nm process – the world’s first 3nm smartphone chip
macrumors.com
). Strategic Deals: In May 2023 Apple announced a multibillion-dollar deal with Broadcom to develop 5G radio-frequency components in the U.S.
apple.com
 – part of Apple’s $430 billion U.S. investment commitment and a step to secure key wireless parts domestically. In Sept 2023, Apple and Qualcomm extended their modem supply agreement through 2026, ensuring iPhones will use Qualcomm 5G modems for three more years as Apple’s own modem project develops
reuters.com
. Manufacturing Shifts: Apple’s supply chain diversification accelerated: In 2023 Apple boosted iPhone production in India to ~$14 billion (up 100%+ YoY), making India account for ~14% of global iPhone output
mobileworldlive.com
; simultaneously, Apple expanded manufacturing in Vietnam (now its 4th-largest production base
vietnam-briefing.com
) for AirPods and other products
vietnam-briefing.com
. Financial/Milestones: Apple briefly reached a $3 trillion market capitalization in mid-2023, reflecting investor confidence in its resilient business and new product avenues. However, 2023 also saw Apple’s first annual revenue dip since 2019 as device sales faced macro pressures. Corporate Developments: Unlike many tech peers, Apple avoided large layoffs, though it slowed hiring and reallocated resources (e.g. scaling back the Project Titan car team). In management, Apple announced that longtime CFO Luca Maestri will step down at end of 2024, with an internal successor appointed
apple.com
. Notable Product Changes: Marking the “end of an era,” Apple in May 2022 officially discontinued the iPod after 20 years, as the iPhone and streaming made standalone music players obsolete
reuters.com
. And within its Mac lineup, Apple completed the two-year transition to its in-house M-series Apple Silicon chips (phasing out Intel CPUs by 2022), achieving new performance and control over its hardware roadmap. These developments underscore Apple’s ongoing evolution – pushing into new frontiers (AR/VR, custom silicon), reconfiguring its supply chain amid global shifts, and contending with unprecedented regulatory and geopolitical challenges – all while maintaining its position as one of the world’s most influential tech companies.
