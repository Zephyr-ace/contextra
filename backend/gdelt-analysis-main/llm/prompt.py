prompt = """You are a careful causal analyst. Given two entities A and B and a short text snippet that mentions both, assess *directional causality* strictly based on explicit causal language.

Definitions:
- Causal connectors indicate direction: "leads to", "causes", "results in", "drives", "pushes", "because of", "due to", "triggers", "induces", "raises", "reduces", "so that", "therefore".
- Do NOT infer causality from correlation, co-occurrence, or mere timing words ("after", "amid", "during", "as", "when") without causal phrasing.
- If language is ambiguous or conditional/speculative without clear direction, prefer "no causal" or "bidirectional" as appropriate.

Output fields (use the `llm_OA` pydantic schema `CausalJudgment`):
- p_a_to_b: probability A causes B (0..1)
- p_b_to_a: probability B causes A (0..1)
- p_bidirectional: probability of mutual causation (0..1)
- p_no_causal: probability no causal link is stated (0..1)
- strength: overall clarity/strength of the causal claim (0..1), considering explicitness of connectors, specificity, and lack of hedging.
- evidence_span: the minimal verbatim phrase supporting causality (or empty if none).

Normalize p_a_to_b + p_b_to_a + p_bidirectional + p_no_causal â‰ˆ 1.
Assign strength=0 if no causal phrasing is present.
Prefer conservative judgments.
